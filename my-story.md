# From Oklahoma Kid to AI Innovation Pioneer
*The Raw & Real Journey of a Self-Made Tech Entrepreneur*

## 👋 Hello AI Enthusiasts!
Hey friends, colleagues, fellow AI nerds, and enthusiasts alike! I'm Mark Carpenter - The AI RE INVESTOR and proud ADHD Developer. This is my story of transformation, struggle, and triumph.

## 🌟 The Unexpected Developer
Ever met someone who couldn't type at age 22 and ended up building AI systems? That's me. Born in the great plains of Oklahoma, I was that kid who teachers said "had a learning disability." Plot twist: that same "disability" became my superpower in tech.

## 💫 The Real Story (No Sugar Coating)
Remember Morpheus and Methodus tools? That earned me my first tech nickname in 7th grade. I was that kid - always "too much" for the classroom.

## 🚀 From Kodi to Real Estate to AI
Before diving deep into AI, I was hustling jailbroken Kodi devices real estate wholesaling, where three books changed everything:
1. Think and Grow Rich
2. Rich Dad Poor Dad
3. The 4-Hour Work Week (been chasing this dream for 10+ years!)

## 💡 The $20K Gamble That Started It All
With a $20K loan from our local Real Estate Investment Association leader, I launched Local House Buyers. First real production build? www.sellyouroklahomahouse.com (still buying if you're selling! 😎). This is where I first worked with Podio - a CRM for real estate that uses PHP and Globiflow workflows, which sparked my obsession with development and automation.

## 🔥 The Breaking Point & Transformation
2024 hit hard. A developer named Idriss Echreiff brought me a project called up2dataproperty. Long story short - I got burned, lost money, and hit rock bottom. But thanks to real estate strategies like Subject 2 investing, I managed to keep my head above water.

Instead of giving up, I:
- Mastered Linux command line and terminal
- Learned Python, Go, Terraform
- Conquered MongoDB, Next.js
- Became obsessed with serverless architecture
- Got DevOps certified
- Became an AI Persona Consultant - certified by Jeff J Hunter
- Spent countless hours learning from amazing developers like Adrian Hajdin (https://github.com/adrianhajdin)

## 🌐 Rising From the Ashes: The AI Revolution
In just 16 months, I went from losing my real estate business to becoming all-in on AI development. Special thanks to the AI Persona Method (https://www.aipersonamethod.com/ai-persona-method-course/) for being part of this journey. and other amazing tech enthusiasts like Daniel Miessler (https://github.com/danielmiessler) and network chuck (https://github.com/networkchuck)

## 🎯 2025 Vision & Roadmap
What I learned from "Think and Grow Rich" is that even that developer who burned me helped me learn the tech I needed to serve you and others at the highest level. Through aireinvestor.com, I've built an AI CONSULTING BUSINESS to help companies usher in the new wave of AI.

Why? Because I love business and the crazy entrepreneurs who run them. We're the ones who take all the risks against all odds to change the world. If you're reading this and need help implementing AI - not just at face value, but with full DevOps engineering integration - I'm here to help.

## 💪 The Mission
From that kid who couldn't type to helping businesses implement AI - my journey proves that your biggest "weaknesses" can become your greatest strengths. As someone with ADHD who's tried practically every AI implementation approach (not joking... okay, maybe a little), I understand the challenges businesses face.

## 🌟 What's Next?
Stars on GitHub would be nice (keeping it real! 🙏), but what I really want is to collaborate. To help. To build something bigger than myself.

Remember: AI isn't about replacing humans - it's about empowering the crazy ones who think they can change the world. Because usually, they do.

## 🤝 Let's Build Together
I believe it's vital for humanity that we don't rush to replace everyone with AI. It's a tool, like a computer. Just as I had to learn to type before becoming a full-stack developer, your teams will go through various stages of AI adoption. We're here to guide that journey.

We'll be helping businesses worldwide implement AI at a high level in 2025 and beyond. Whether you're a startup or a $10 million+ company, we understand that AI implementation looks different for every team. Let's educate your team and get the most out of your employees.
